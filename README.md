JCPU
====

JCPU is a processor simlulator framework. It is based on LLVM and JIT the native code. It aimes performance and portability.

Basic instructions of openrisc and RISCV-V are implemented now.
JCPU is licensed under GPL2 so far.
It shows more than 150M insns / sec.


TODO:

0) 64bit subset of RISC-V

1) Suvervisor instructions of RISC-V

2) MMU

3) Bigger test program

4) More documentation

5) Can run on LLVM-3.6 and newer
